        <p>
            &emsp;The sun at the end-of-days shined so bright. Its sloppy photon kisses blew to the Earth and he accepted them in an ostentatious show of their great
            love. But the clouds caught them in the act, and felt lonely. They decided that no one should love if not them, but no matter how hard they tried, they
            couldn’t keep Sun and Earth apart. So they bided their time, they waited. And when the sun finally disappeared over the horizon with its brilliant 
            promise at a beautiful tomorrow, the clouds grew vengeful and took their pent-up anger out to Earth. And a little townhome off the main road, way down
            on the surface was caught in their violent crossfire. The angry grey clouds rolled onward, rain crashing to tin roof, coming down in a sonorous fell. 
            Lighting strobed in terror and despair while its thunder cried a bloodied murder. And in that tiny house the little boy in pale blue pajamas held 
            tight to his stuffed dinosaur and cried under the coverlet. Then Vena walked in, to rescue his little boy. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena was man of about 40 years, and every one of those years had been spent looking for Truth. He was of average height and had strong, strong arms, 
            though his control of them was far too crude for them to be useful anymore. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Tommy?” He ventured, “Are you okay?” The sobbing coming from under the coverlet grew louder. And the thunder did too, as if in competition with the
            boy’s resigned cries. Rain continued to sheet across and into the window. Vena barely fit in the twin bed next to his son. He lifted the little blanket 
            and revealed the shuddering boy’s wet face, and his damp teddy dino. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“It’s okay little guy, the rain will go away.” Vena held his son. “And I’m right here.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Tommy finally spoke up, but he stumbled over and slurred his words, “But isso loud. Issgonna get me.” He sniffled. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Trust me, you’ll be okay as long as I’m here.” Tommy wasn’t pleased. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Look son, I can’t make the thunder and lightning go away, but I can sit right here and I can hold you.” ”That’sall awant daddy, just hold me.” Vena
            smiled, Tommy followed. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena pulled his arms tighter. Careful! Not too tight, and Tommy slowly fell into sleep in the arms of his father. Vena pulled the covers over his 
            son and whispered, “Sweet dreams little buddy, rest well. ‘For Aucipet blesses those who rest.’” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena got out of his son’s bed and walked back to his dim master bedroom. He loved his son, but he wasn’t Truth. Vena didn’t turn on the light as he
            entered. He knew the space and almost preferred the dark. Tommy was afraid of the dark because of the monsters hiding in it, but that was precisely why
            Vena liked it. In the dark you weren’t alone. Sure your company was monstrous, but that was always better than the grey silence. At the head of the room
            was his deep brown bed. It was wide and wood grained. Only the right side was made and neat. Vena first built the bed as a gift, but now it was just a
            lonely reminder of another Untruth. Just like his desk in the corner. On that desk was a wood toy he was engraving for Tommy, and next to it was a red
            candle, and a little black box, a cube. He stepped over to the candle with the unknown scent and lit it with a match. After, he peeled off his clothes
            and took a tepid shower. Just as he always did. He dried off and crept to bed. Just as he always did. Then he got in on the left side, careful not to
            disturb the right. Just as he always did. And he started to doze. The end of another day. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;He woke later that night to a loud incessant vibrating, sound coming from… somewhere. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;He shot up in bed like an escaped moth trying hopelessly for the moon. </i>Could this be it?</i> Muscled arms reached to check the phone so quickly
            that Vena almost tumbled out of bed. It wasn’t ringing. Then he looked over at the cube. It moved back and forth across the desk as if shaken as if shaken
            by a spirit-hand. <i>This *is* it, he thought.</i> He rang Yareli. They picked up immediately. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Hey Yarels, it’s doing the thing.” He stared at the cube on his desk. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Shit, now? Meet me at The Pillar.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena got back out of bed. Carefully again. Then he walked over the vibrating black box on his desk in the corner. He dressed himself for the second
            time today, a button-up shirt and slacks. He marched down the hall to the garage with the vibrating cube in hand. By the time he was settled and pulling 
            out of his driveway, the clouds had given up their wet guerilla retribution. And Vena began his drive through foggy air to the pub like a lone migrant 
            animal walking over the shell casings and spent gunpowder of an old, retired battlefield. The trees along the dirt road held position as if they had just
            completed a beautiful ballet, something by Delibes perhaps, and were presently pushing their finishing poses into dimension for the adoration and 
            applause of their audience, humanity. Few ever looked up long enough to notice, let alone to laud the trees as they so deserved. But they held fast 
            nonetheless, waiting for the day when someone would arrive to finally appreciate them as they so earned. Vena was daily that devotee, until the city 
            came and mowed them over for more power lines. Yet another Untruth. He drove on, and eventually reached the end of the road and entered the city. It was
            darker and foggier there, but Vena could still see past the obscura with ease, and he knew the way. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;There was an abnormal number of Enforcers on the street tonight. They all drove their own personal cars, but you could tell who they were simply by
            the way that they drove. Stopping at yellow, even when the coast was clear. Never touching the crosswalks, even in the most empty parts of town. Always 
            alert, always watching. And always ready to pounce at the first sign of dissent. There were so many of them. Vena practically seemed the only non-Enforcer
            on the street. They must’ve been looking for someone. The black box in the passenger’s seat kept buzzing, an excited electron. <i>I hope Yareli knows what
            they’re doing.</i> Vena drove with his windows down and tasted the cool night air. Music and air conditioning bothered him in the car. He liked to listen
            to and look the world as it was. He wanted to smell the wet air unadulterated, and straight from the source. He was distracted. The cube kept jostling and
            dancing in its seat. The people on the sidewalk were so strange and interesting. The air smelled so right. And Tommy! He forgot about Tommy! Red light, 
            green light, stop sign, Enforcer. Street performer, left turn, gear change, red light. Cube cube cube. Before he knew it, he was there. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Buildings in the city were usually snuggly packed together, tight and without room, but this singular plot of land was different. Vena pulled into 
            the parking lot of the low, massive cylindrical building. The Pillar Pub. Its windows boasted many lives. Its signs boasted many flavors. He parked and 
            took the cube in hand. His bones vibrated in phase with that little black box. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Inside, the place was full and bustling and lit with more than just candelabras. The Pillar Pub had a cylindrical bar in the center of the room, 
            equipped with as much alcohol as one could ever want, and a charismatic bartender to boot. Yareli was sitting in the corner booth next to a small skin-
            tone backpack, waiting. The cylindrical space also had a stage at the head, for their nightly open mic. There was always a rotating procession of guys-
            with-guitars playing their painless “new original songs”, or some teen delivering the also painless, and thus inevitably bad, poetry of youth. Presently,
            a small band called the V’s loudly covered the new hit single “I’ll Sex You In”. It was also painless, all the art delivered on that stage was painless.
            And so it wasn’t the Truth. The only people that seemed to notice were Yareli and Vena. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“What do I do with this thing?” Vena slammed the black box down on the table. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“You have to go up there and show them the Truth.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“I have no clue what that means.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Just go up there, place your hand on top of the box, and the rest will come to you.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena sat back and the booth’s cushion gave way. He put his head in his hands. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Yareli, I’ve spent my whole life looking for Truth. I started with school. I got a doctorate and put myself into work, but there was no Truth. So 
            I tried religions: Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Santeria Voodoo, hell I even made a few up, but still there were no Truths. I went to
            find myself in nature, up mountains and down valleys, even there was no truth. Love, family, drugs, pure hedonism, all untruths. I even lived in a-” 
            Vena’s voice broke as he realized he was shouting. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“I even went and lived in a fucking cave, alone. After it all, I’ve just ended up right back here, with nothing, and no one, nowhere and with no 
            Truths.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“There’s one thing you haven’t tried.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“What?” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“The black box Vena. That’s why I gave you the black box.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Then tell me what to fucking do with it!” Vena slammed his fist on the table. Now he was proper angry, and even the most inebriated patrons started
            to look over. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Yareli’s light eyes were calm. They seared into Vena. Yareli simply pointed at the stage. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Show them the Truth.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;An exasperated sigh escaped him, “If I’m gonna go make a fool of myself on that stage, can I at least get a drink first?” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“No, no stalling. You want to see the Truth? You want to show the Truth? Go. Now.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;”Okay, I’ll go. By the way, what’s in the bag.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Oh that? Plan B.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena tilted his head, confused. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Just go V.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;He walked over to the foot of the stage’s steps. That insensate cover band had left the stage just in time. The black box vibrated more violently
            than ever, he could barely keep hold of it. Luckily he had strong, strong arms. Many of the oglers from earlier watched as he walked timidly onto the 
            stage. He stood there for a while unsure of what to do. How could this… cube… show me the Truth, and here? He looked over at Yareli. They stared back 
            at him and motioned him forward. With an encouraging smile and crazed eyes. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena put down the black box in the center of the wooden stage and palmed the top. Nothing happened. <i>Do something, anything, please. I need this.</i>
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Just then the rBiske began to grow. It was the left side first, then the top, then the whole thing. And it kept growing, and growing, and growing. 
            When it was done, Vena stood behind a glassy black rectangular prism, slightly taller than even him, and wide enough to fit a body. It didn’t shift and 
            expand like a robot might, it didn’t inflate like a balloon, it just grew. And so did Vena//SOMA. He picked up a top hat prop The Pillar provided, and 
            tossed it on. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;He yelled out over the crowd. “Hello everyone! My name is Vena//SOMA,” He threw his head back and groped for the sky when he said ‘//SOMA’, like a 
            gun does when it fires a bullet, like an accusation, like a conviction. Anyone who wasn’t watching him before certainly was now. Even the bartender quit
            shaking martinis and sliding beers around the central bar. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“I’ll need a volunteer for this… trick. Any takers?” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Everyone looked around rather confused. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Really? Not one is willing to give themselves for the joy and… artistic pleasure of the others in the audience. Anyone? Anyone? Don’t make her pick.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;This only made the crowd all the more confused. But one rose. A 22-year old girl with brunette hair and lazy brown eyes. She wore a green shirt
            with Tetris blocks on it and flared brown pants. In the back sitting with her was another young man. She started wobbling towards the stage, much to the 
            protest of her lover. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“I-bdbbb do it. Looks fun.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Excellent.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena//SOMA helped her onto the stage. He dug his fingers into the side of the rBiske and his hand melded into it like clay. He pulled, and the front 
            opened like a door. He leaned down and whispered into her ear before shoving her into the black box and closing the door. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Scream true, give yourself to the search, and let agony run deep and abound. We’re about to see the Truth and make something beautiful of it. I 
            thank you, Giver.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“buh?” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;She couldn’t tell, but the inside of the rBiske was larger than it looked on the outside. So large in fact that one could walk for eternities in 
            there and never find the walls again. She was confused in the box, unsure of what was happening, but not for long. The pain made sure of that. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The instant Vena//SOMA slammed the rBiske's, he lost control. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;There once was a someone, somewhere, sometime. This was a faceless someone. A someone who was anyone and everyone and no one, always. Tonight it was
            SOMA. And SOMA saw the unseen through the eye of the Sightless. And SOMA sensed the unskimmed thorough the hand of the Slipped. Aucipet saw and showed him
            the Truth. Manea felt and moved him with it. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;He started pounding the sides of the box like a million-million emaciated children might beat on a table, demanding a meal. Percussive rhythm beat
            the ear drums of every person in the crowd. Complimented only by the screaming melody. The violent shrieking. Inside the box, the Giver’s brain felt like
            it was on fire. Her nose ran with blood. She tried to staunch the flow. Too much, too much. Her hands and wrists and arms and shoes were drenched in 
            crimson. It was flowing from her pores now. She should’ve blacked out, but the rBiske kept her alive. Only to torture her more. Agony was needed of 
            course, to see the Truth. She gave up on staunching it and tried to hold her head through that splitting headache. That’s when SOMA switched the song, 
            and her legs gave out. They must’ve shattered. But no, they were intact. The pain, the pain, the pain. The blood, oh how she bled. Back outside the 
            rBiske SOMA dipped into the box’s side and pulled out a glob of black. It stretched from the rBiske, and it formed into strings between his hand and the 
            box. He strummed a new melody. The Giver turned to wails. Glasses shattered in the room. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Their dual-creation was so beautiful. It had the controlled interplay of something by Chopin, the meter of a Keats poem, and the surrealism of 
            something sketched up by Dalí. It was a most beautiful created thing. It had no words, but the Truth flowed through it nonetheless. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Her boyfriend realized what was happening and shot up out of chair. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Let her go-” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Before he even finished the sentence, Yareli had a rope and strapped down into the chair. The rest of the audience was rapt, spellbound even. They
            saw the Truth in it, they did nothing to stop it. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;SOMA grew frenetic. He pulled hard on a new glob. The Giver felt their left hand come out of its socket. For real this time. Pop. Vena pulled harder,
            it came out further and even after it had fully disconnected from her wrist, some skin held on. Don’t let go. SOMA pulled harder, and in new places. Giver
            shrilled her throat red raw. Vena was going too far, but Aucipet was showing him the truth, Manea had taken his body, he couldn’t stop now. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;There are many kinds of pain. Artistic pain turns its victim into a poet. The pain of loss or of despair rends its victims and turns them philosophical.
            Agony brings thought. One cannot help but wax rhapsodic in the throws of suffering. But her’s wasn’t a lucid pain. It was something different, something 
            new. This was animal pain. The kind that makes one want to flee. To push it away. It didn’t bring enlightenment or revelation or epiphany, it only brought
            the fear and the trembling. It came from some offshot-offshot tunnel down in the labrynthine depths of her. She bled, oh she bled. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Yareli was sitting next to the lover with one leg over the other, leaning back in his chair. SOMA kept playing his grim instrument, to the universe’s great metronome. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;That’s when Yareli heard the Enforcer sirens. He looked over to his left, and the lover had his phone in hand. Its screen was flashing red. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“What the hell did you do?” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“The only thing I knew how.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Yareli picked up the skin-color backpack and stepped outside. The bartender wanted to see what the convocation outside was about, so he stepped out too. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Outside, the Enforcers stood behind their casual cars in casual clothes. One had a megaphone. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Yareli and the Bartender stood between them and the door. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“We know what you are! Let her out of the box and no one gets hurt! If you fail to comply, we will raid this Pub.” The bartender spoke up first, it was his establishment after all, “No, she volunteered.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“If you fail to comply, we will raid this Pub!” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“You may send in one, to help her when they’re done.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“If you fail to comply, we will raid this Pub!” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“I said you may send in one.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“If you fail to comply, we will raid this Pub!” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The bartender looked over at Yareli. “I’m done with this.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;He opened a pocket on his coat and clicked a button. Between them and the Enforcers, a large, spiked fence rose tall from the ground and surrounded
            the Pillar. They would not comply. The bartender stepped up to it. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The Enforcers turned into an inward circle and paused for a while before someone stepped up and called out through the fence, this time the voice
            was new, and softer. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“We want to just send in a few medics to make sure everyone is okay.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“You send in medics and you’ll get back ash. Send one.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“We’ll want to give them stunners, just for their own safety.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“The hell you say.” He replied, “You get one, and no weapons.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“But how can we make sure they’ll be safe if-“ 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Yareli finally got tired of the whole exchange. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“SEND MORE THAN ONE AND I’LL GO FUCKING NUCLEAR IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER.” Their voice broke off at the end. They held the skin-toned bag high above 
            their small head, crediting the threat. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Calm down Yareli,” the bartender whispered. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;But it worked. The Enforcers wavered and turned inward to a circle once more, to pick the one. They couldn’t seem agree, then someone stepped forward. The Enforcers were a citizen-led force, so they didn’t need to wear a uniform. This woman had one. Enforcer Chief Lombok. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;She was a stout woman of about 40. She was burly and had strong, strong arms, though her control of them was far too crude for them to be useful 
            anymore. She swayed and tore thorough the fog like a fast clipper ship on a tempestuous sea. The bartender tapped something on a panel in his jacket, 
            and part of the fence fell for her. She pulled through and it rose quickly behind her. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“I’ll do it. Let’s go inside.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;They turned back into the building. Lombok the Enforcer trundled closed behind them. Yareli turned his head down and back to say something to her. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“You will sit and listen, and when she’s done, she’s all yours. If she finishes.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Fine.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Lombok the Enforcer took a seat between the lover and Yareli. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;SOMA kept playing, he had been the whole time. The lover would never recover from the sound of her suffering. Manea began to take control from 
            Aucipet. SOMA moved to dancing around the rBiske, humming, chanting, and throwing his head back. Leaning into the chaos, and appealing even further to 
            the Godmuses. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;His arms gesticulated wildly at strange angles, and his body oscillated back and forth in stranger convulsion. His legs stepped precisely, violently
            across the stage as Manea took his body and Aucipet cried the truth to him. He danced like a live fish over a fire. And just like that fish, something 
            primeval thrashed him and something powerful leapt up through him. To be controlled by Manea was to be haunted. It was beautiful to be haunted. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;SOMA began to speak. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“ 
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;You haven’t felt the pain in so so long. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Seared in beginning, wear safe gloves. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Foot ache in beginning, slip into easy moccasins. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The cold! The cold! Adorn soft sealskin. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Win the fight with suffering.
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;You reject the all-joy. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;You reject the all-pain. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;You want the in-between. 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Euphoria, feels so right, 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;but it’s terribly boring. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Horribly banal. 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;But pain pierces, 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Suffering sears, 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Pleasure… pleases. 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;We fattened ourselves, got so safe. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;But we need the pain.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Suffering, bring the Great Truth! 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The ancients were fools, like you, 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;but they hurt first 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;and so they created 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;pure poetry. 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The first pure poets. 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;The last pure poets. 
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Suffering, bring the Great Truth ! 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Remember when pain was new ! 
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Oh remember, when pain was new! 
            <br>
            ” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp; He continued playing for several agonizing minutes. Every second was an eternity in the rBiske. Lombok the Enforcer couldn’t take it anymore. She
            stood up so briskly that her chair fell backwards. “THERE IS NO GREAT TRUTH-” she called out, up from the crowd. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Shut the fuck up, SOMA SPEAKS,” Yareli shot her a glance. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“No, no more listening. My turn! Trust me, I’ve gone looking too and there isn’t a damn thing out there. Nothing and no one cares about you or me or any of this. And they’re perfectly right to. Let her go, get down off that stage, and let’s all give up. There’s no point to anything. No truth here or anywhere. Our lives are empty and meaningless.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;SOMA spoke again. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“Wrong! Wrong! What do you mean the human life is meaningless?! We are the eyes and minds of the universe. Beauty, love, joy, none exist without us.
            The sense is nothing without the sensor. We are the magnum opus of the universe and the heavens. In that sense, the human life is the most meaningful- 
            the most important thing. We must protect each other and ourselves. We must propel ourselves into the future, we must propagate across the galaxy. We 
            must work to understand all and solve all and build into that most beautiful human future. Poiesis! we must become poets! We must find artistic beauty in
            every human endeavor, therein lies the Truth.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Lombok was stunned. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;SOMA was done, he had seen and shown the Truth. He stopped playing and moved in front of the rBiske. The room of onlookers reveled in the beauty of what they had just seen. He pulled the door open again. Reality came rushing back into the black box. Vena//SOMA peered inside and saw nothing of the Giver but a pile of sanguinated legs and arms, a brunette head lay farther off, and of course intestines and other innards were splayed the whole way between. Vena//SOMA shrugged. He closed the door, placed his hand on the front of the box, and willed it back down to size. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The rBiske turned into a little cube again, and Vena//SOMA picked it up. He stepped off the wood stage. The Pillar Pub was full of confused patrons and broken glass. A beer tap leaked. Candelabras flared and wavered. Vena//SOMA walked over to the still-stunned Lombok. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;“I know you’re lost. Order isn’t a Truth. Take the rBiske. Reach into SOMA. Let Aucipet and Manea show you a real Truth.” 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Vena//SOMA took her hand and placed the little black box in it. He kept his hands wrapped around hers and looked in her eyes. She was aghast still,
            dumfounded. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Manea then returned to the Aether, Aucipet dried his eye and Vena was left there in a similarly dumbfounded presque vu, unsure of entirely what had
            just happened. Lombok was all the more dazed. The lover was crying, still tied to his chair.

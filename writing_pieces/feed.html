            &emsp;I am very, conflicted about this book. It felt like a Y.A novel, and the middle of the book wasn't particularly interesting as it felt more like a vehicle
            to the big events of the ending instead of a destination in itself. The theme is important, but in today's age it feels trite.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The main message is the idea that humans prize convenience above all else (including meaningful connection and even happiness) and thus our complacent, 
            apathetic laziness consumes us if we aren't careful. Humans are sort of being elevated to the status of Gods with our newfound technological and scientific
            powers. With all the arrogance and pomp and mecurialitiy of the same. Masters of their fate and yet unthinking about what that fate should be. Blindly 
            forging forward. We societally fall hard and fast for any technology that offers more of that all-important convenience, as long as it isn't too unethical,
            and this flippant submission to new technology that brings us some good with little to no reasoned consideration for knock-on effects just might be the end
            of that beautiful dream of human intelligence we once had. Anderson captures that quite well in this book. He beautifully and painfully projects the loss 
            of creative use of language, the death of thoughtful art, the grimy grasp of late stage capitalism into our individual lives, and the overall extremely vapid,
            unthinking society that extreme convenience will indubitably create.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Today, we know social media polarizes us. We know apps like TikTok and Instagram shrink our attention spans and monopolize our time and warp our 
            perceptions of the minds and lives of others. We know that Snapchat and text messaging are not meaningful, fulfilling ways to connect to each other, and 
            yet we still engage thoughtlessly in each of these, en masse. Many, large corporations even benefit from our stupid submission. The obvious question then
            is why the hell do we still do those things?! They are bad for us and we know it. It, as Anderson projects in this book, will only get worse as we get 
            more and more technologically advanced. The smarter we get, the stupider we get.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;I even feel personally changed by this book. I was already aware (as many teens and adults are now) of the problems of blind submission to shiny new tech,
            but I feel like the book made those problems vivid and lucid in a way I haven't thought of them before. In fact I'm beginning to actually change my life 
            because of how melancholic the book made me feel. This book was so striking and mericiless that it made me start experimenting with digial minimalism!
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Anderson challenges us all to start being more critical and careful of the technology we use. I would recommend it to anyone who isn't already painfully, 
            sorrowfully aware of that. 4/5 stars.

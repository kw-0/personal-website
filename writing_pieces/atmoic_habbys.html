            &emsp;I feel like I was pretty aware of most of what this book had to say from places like YouTube and even from other books. Because it is such a good book people
             across the internet shared its ideas and those have reached me even before the book did, so when I finally bought and read it there wasn’t much left for me to 
             learn from it. Don’t get me wrong- it is a good book- but you can learn everything it has to say elsewhere and faster. Also James Clear’s writing style feels 
             like a string of aphorisms. Many of the chapters were centered around one useful idea and then that idea was either repeated in different ways several times or 
             surrounded by examples that didn’t add much to my understanding of that idea. Because of that, this book felt like a slog to read compared to even other 
             self-improvement books I’ve read as I was already knowledgeable about what he had to say, and his writing style and delivery are largely uninteresting.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Normally I avoid reading self help books, because many seem to claim to have the silver bullet solution to every problem you’ve ever had and many of
             the ideas those books have are either obvious, intangible, or just demonstrably untrue. I decided to read this one though because I’d heard so many good things
             about it. It does have useful lessons, but at this point you as a reader would be better served looking up videos about the book and spending your time reading
             about more novel concepts that haven’t been spread across the internet.
             <br><br>
             &emsp;3/5 stars.

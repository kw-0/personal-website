        <p>
            &emsp;Her body was a lithe and graceful thing. She turned the empty, blank room into her own. Dim light emanated from a dirty bulb in the center of the 
            room. That light became her muse, and she moved through it with divine purpose. Her legs and arms twirled and swept and tumbled around her rangy body. 
            Cell and tissue, muscle and organ, they all moved in concert to create <i>meaning itself</i>. She spun and rolled and leapt in a swirling tempest of 
            poetic expression. Every step thundered with a seismic precision, a seismic specificity.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Her thighs and flanks led every step. Her biceps and chest, every stretching grasp. Her mind was not in control. She knew that the realms of 
            artistry and rational thought don’t exist as separate. Instead, that mind’s realm lives in many little bubbles in the immiscible ether of pure poetry. 
            And her body pulled her through this liquid world of creation, diving in and out of floating pools of reason. You could see in her dance that the mind 
            worked as a subject, no, a student of the body. This was the somatic epiphany in a most sterling form.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;And here there was no music. She didn’t need it. She was the concert. She was the symphony. Her body the orchestra. Her mind the conductor. The 
            blank walls, her spellbound audience. Those movements were so perfect and striking that those worn, paper white walls almost resonated in phase with her 
            immaculate beauty. They almost banded and bent and broke and bowed. They almost fell at her feet to worship at that holy temple of the body.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;It was as if God himself had seen her sweeping beauty and thus granted her true locomotive free will. She danced through all dimensions. Not just 
            length and width or even just breadth, she was free to dance through time. And through it she flowed. She was free to gambol and gyrate and push through 
            spirit. Oh how free she felt, here in this mirthless room. It was unworthy of her glory. If only those walls could feel too. She would dip and they would 
            worry. She would leap and triumph would bound through them just the same. She would keel backwards with her hands and feet outstretched, and those damned 
            walls would weep. This was sweeped arm and thrusted step. Convex back, and concave soul. This girl had finally broken through that human consciousness and 
            found her way  into potent, pungent passion. Her body became the vessel for that fluid truth she’d found there.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;This frolicking was the rawest form of art. Poetry of the body. Dance, motion, a most wonderful thing! This was ineffable feeling hardened to the 
            concrete of action. She sculpted the air around her into something new. She inked space itself with vestiges of her own soul. Presently above that body, 
            stony arms reached high above her head in a blind grope towards the heavens. Legs and calves and pointed toes smote downward into inferno. She whirled 
            into a final finishing pose and petrified like a statue. Her final motion quickly pushing an evanescent idyll into dimension. Body returned to mind, and 
            thus her dance, thus her poem, was complete.

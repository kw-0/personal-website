            &emsp;“May the sun scorch his countenance, may the ground rise against him, and may the mother-goddess herself bray him in the palm of her loving hand. 
            Tonight he shall be delivered to us, and so we can finally be freed! Tonight we enter the river as pariahs, but we will exit it as new Humans! 
            As the celestial bodies align we will be rebirthed!” Antehe the Regrounded shouted over the crowd, and euphoric resounding whoops and shouts 
            rose from the  party.

            <br><br>…<br><br>

            &emsp;The celebrants reveled in the glory of the Greenness, for tonight was the night. Percussive drumming soared through the valley, friendly wind 
            fluted through the treetops, and even the most tone-deaf Vieretesse vocalized in phase with it all. Tonight was the night. Just as Antehe 
            foretold, the moon and earth and sun, even the stars would align for them, and so they could finally be free. Human animals all along the river 
            ate themselves full of the food they’d foraged and drank of the river’s cool water. Elsewhere along the valley revelers wrestled. Some swam among 
            the river fish and others simply cuddled together in the sweet grass as the beautiful music wafted overhead. Sheep grazed around the party and 
            prismatic Ibis along the river plucked at worms. Bleats and caws and human howls.  Tonight was the night. Together the Viertesse had rejected the 
            techining of the new world and this final festival was to be their prize. They danced, they danced, they danced. Oh the pure, orgasmic pleasure of 
            being with one another. The pure, orgasmic pleasure of being. Above their celebration, the eclipsing moon began its change to tawny red, and darkness
            began its descent into their valley. But for now they danced and ate and sang and swam, for tonight was the night.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Far outside the ECODOME, across the empty expanse of dust and sagebrush and earth beaten raw, on the twentieth and lowest floor of Government House 
            John woke with a start. The sleepsim he had chosen for that night was so immersive he had almost forgotten. He unplugged from his Port, slid out of 
            his NapSac onto the cold metal floor, and grabbed the vial fabricating in his printer. One has to be careful about printing meds sometimes. His printer 
            was top of the line, his father was CEO of course, but sometimes the prints were faulty. And faultily printed meds could kill someone. But that was a 
            risk he had to take, for tonight was the night. This one though was particularly dangerous,  an anesthetic. It was a silvery-purple viscous liquid that 
            smelled foul. The mirror image form of this compound, the sweet smelling kind, would cause grotesque boils, violent vomiting, and eventually painful 
            death as the all the victim’s blood competed to escape through every orifice, pore, and hole in the body. John checked and the vial passed his smell 
            test, this was just a simple anesthetic. Was he really going to do this? The Vieritesse he loved so much were counting on him, but his own father? 
            John padded quietly over to his door hatch and waved it open. They all lived underground these days, the air above was too toxic, and so each door 
            had to be be airtight. It open with a pop and John crept down the hall towards the CEO of the United States’ sleepsim room. Could he really do this?
            <br><br>
            &emsp;About halfway down the pristine white hallway something rang off inside John’s head. His Port had sensed his tension and the voice of his Port
            AI rang true in his skull. 
            <br><br>
            “Even as void within him, you were,” it echoed. 
            <br><br>
            “Cyril, now is not the time. We’ve disscussed this.”
            <br><br>
            “You are the created thing, the lump of clay, the vessel. You are beholden to the hand that feeds.” Cyril retorted.
            <br><br>
            “But-- ”
            <br><br>
            “You lost your balence, you were scarred. He mended. He cared.”
            <br><br>
            John quavered, “But… But the Vieritesse are counting on me. I love him, but he’s trying to destroy this deep part of me and so I must help them. 
            Its only an anesthetic. They’ll only take him to talk.”
            <br><br>
            Cyril sensed dread deep within his host.
            <br><br>
            “It… It'll be fine.”
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Suddenly John began to flit through memory. Oh, those nights with the Vieritesse, those nights with Mateo. They would climb and run and hunt together. 
            Even now John could feel Mateo’s heat across his front, the cool grass on his bare back. Even now John could feel Mateo’s primality in their little 
            circle of passion and love. Ah! Those beautiful trysts! The Vieritesse had escaped the techining. They had recreated the old world for themselves. 
            They had reached back through time and space and grasped at something primitive. In reconnecting to the ground the Vieritesse could finally freewheel 
            through mind and body and spirit. They could run! They could leap! They were free from these new world bindings! It was truly something beautiful.  And 
            now he had to decide between them and his love, or the kindred father who would destroy them all in one fell swoop.
            <br><br>
            He inched closer to his father’s hatch door. Could he really do this to the dad who held him, even from the beginning?
            <br><br>
            “Your link to family never breaks, it bends, then mends.”  Cyril rang again.
            <br><br>
            “Stop! He hurts the people love! He hurts the things I love. I’m going to do it!” John shook with the unsure force of the thought.
            <br><br>
            Cyril turned strangely silent.
            <br><br>
            Oh to have to choose! Between his lover and friends or the last of the family that had held him safe in this collapsing world.
            <br><br>
            “Cyril, I… I don’t know what to do,” John felt a lump in his throat, “I love the Vieritesse, I love Mateo. They showed me what it means to be human again. What it means to feel and live and love. They showed me what it means to be. But dad was always there for me, he treated me as an equal, he protected me. He guarded me. He loves me.”
            <br><br>
            Cyril didn’t respond.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;John crumbled to the ground and tears began a heasitant rappel down his round, dimpled cheeks. The vial of silvery-purple anesthetic rolled free from 
            his limped hand.
            <br><br>
            “I can’t do-”
            <br><br>
            &emsp;KRRRK!  KRRRRK! KRRRRK!  An alarm screeched in the hallway. Protectorate soldiers rushed in through the main hatch and filed out of the CEO’s room. 
            John was suddenly surrounded. The Protectorate void black uniforms seemed to absorb the very light in the room. John was stuck.
            <br><br>
            “WHAT DID YOU DO?!” John thought so forcefully that his head began to ache.
            <br><br>
            “My job,” Cyril replied in an unusual simplicity.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;A tall man stepped out of the CEO’s open hatch with measured finality. He had a violently angular long face, pale skin, and he was dressed in a wrinkled 
            blue suit as if he’d worn it to sleepsim in his NapSac. He held his right arm out in front of his chest and adjusted his suit cuff. The bright cold light 
            glinted off his watch. He opened his mouth and spoke with the calibrated delicacy that only comes from years of work in beuracracy.
            <br><br>
            “Hello son.”
            <br><br>
            “Dad, its not what it looks like,” John’s throat was suddenly dry, he gulped.
            <br><br>
            “Well it looks like you were trying to sedate me,” John’s dad said as one of the soldiers handed him the vial. He wafted it and recognized its 
            characteristic putrid odor.
            <br><br>
            “But its okay son. I know you’ve been in contact with the Vieritesse, and I know they were trying to manipulate you into helping them. I trust you weren’t 
            going to go through with it?”
            <br><br>
            John pulled in his legs, wrapped his arms around them, and nodded furitvely from the protective shell of his rangy limbs.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The CEO’s face turned to a manical grin, “Well this is excellent! I was patiently awaiting a reason to finally get remove them and this is it.” The CEO 
            practically leapt for joy as he strutted back into his room. John heasitatnly stood up and followed. John’s father waved his hand towards a wall and a 
            holodisplay of the Vieritesse Moon Festival materialized in the center of the room. The Vieritesse began to line up and prepared for the final part of 
            their celebration. The descent into the river.
            <br><br>
            “What are you about to do, dad?!”
            <br><br>
            “I am simply going to do my job.”
            <br><br>
            He pulled up a holographic keyboard and typed something quickly. Two buttons appeared on opposite sides of the room.
            <br><br>
            “You’re going to have to help me though. Stand over there and press that button on my mark,” he said with a tempered, oblivious excitement.
            <br><br>
            What was John to do? In saving his father, in going against the things he loved and believed in, in adhering to filal piety and propriety, John had 
            damned his loves. And now he was going to have to help execute them. His father wouldn’t even know the pain he’d caused.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;He staggered over to the button, and they hit it together. The holodisplay showed drones flying over the head of the river. Some viscous liquid sprayed 
            from them into it.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;John couldn’t take it. And so he ran, over and up, through and around. Past meandering functionaries and night-owl officials. Down white metal corridors 
            and up pristine stairways until he finally arrived at the Government House bunker airlock. He palmed it open. Stepped through the airlock. Out to dusted 
            earth and toxic air. Tears streaked down his face and he collapsed right there. He let the smog wrap its fetid tendrils around his throat. He let it choke 
            the very life out of him. Alive, dead it didn’t matter if he couldn’t be with the ones he so deeply loved. Cyril wailed in John’s skull, but he didn’t 
            care anymore. He should’ve done it. He should’ve done it. He should’ve done it.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Back across the arid earth, through that toxic air, and down in the valley of the ECODOME the Vieritesse began their collective descent into the river. 
            The eclipsing moon turned its tawny red, and great soaring human howls rose from the party. The escaping light off the moon glinted a strange 
            silvery-purple on the river, and a sickly sweet odor wafted through the valley. Mateo, John’s lover, could feel a tingling on his skin as he dipped into 
            the onrushing water.

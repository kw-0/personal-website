            &emsp;This book was an enjoyable, sprawling pocket universe that I was quite happy to get lost in over and over again. In the book, there is a rapid change of
            pace between pages 1-800 and 800-end and state that was an extremely satisfying conclusion to the buildup of the first half. Many if not all of the tense buildup, secrets, and foundation laid in the first half payed off beautifully in the second.
            Despite this, I didn't love the ending section. In fact I feel like in the last sections of the book there were too many sudden reveals. It reached a point
            where I was getting mildly annoyed that every few chapters ended in some big reveal of a secret that the book has been building up.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;This isn’t five stars for me because of that sudden recurring denouement of an ending. I would’ve much preferred a slow drip feeding of those secrets
            throughout the story as opposed to all of the answers and secrets being at the end. The 800-end section wasn’t as exciting for me as the first part because
            the rapid fire reveals became almost rote.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The second reason I didn’t love this as much as the Hyperion Cantos or even KSR’s The Mars Trilogy (even given this book’s more interesting world) is 
            that frankly, the book didn’t have any meaningful themes. Not every book needs to be some grand commentary on the human enterprise or anything, but I think 
            fiction is at its best when it has something to teach us about ourselves or the universe we exist in. The Way of Kings doesn’t really have this. One thousand
            two hundred and fifty two printed pages and the best we get is “life before death” and “journey before destination”?! Maybe there’s something to be said about
            not giving up in Kaladin or Shallan’s stories? These themes just don’t quite land like I’d like them to. Though I suspect that the later books expand on these
            themes in meaningful ways so I’m not discounting the series for that quite yet.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;The first 80% of the novel was extremely enjoyable to me. It was a spellbinding, Full Lashing, magical journey. It is so much fun to just spend days on
            end living in the imagined world of Roshar. I think the length was excellent because of that. But, this book is only a 4 star read to me because it doesn’t 
            pace its payoffs well (the ending felt almost like an Agatha Christie novel), and it doesn’t have a particularly interesting or novel theme (yet). Overall though,
            I would recommend it. The world is just so cool!
            <br><br>
            &emsp;Also, for the love of The Stormfather, I want more time with Hoid he’s just so strange and interesting.
